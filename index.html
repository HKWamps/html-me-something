    <h3><a name="Early">Early Technology Interests</a></h3>
    <div class="text">
        <p>Mike has always been interested in technology, and first started learning
            technology while in High School in the early 80's. Learning on a couple
            of Apple II's that were upgraded with floppy drives over the &quottape machine backup&quot
            that came with them. His major project was to port over the Basic user's guide for the
            TRS-80 to the Apple II so the computer class could have a textbook. It was actually used
            for several years afterwards in the classroom. </p>
        <p>Upon reaching college, the computer program
            was in the math department, so Mike went the engineering route instead. He still used
            computers, and the Academy transitioned from the Dartmouth Main Frame to Macintosh's during
            his tenure at the academy. While in the Coast Guard, he became a systems administrator for the
            unit's Burroughs Technology Operating System (BTOS) computers and obtained his first personal
            PC with GW-Basic.

    <h3><a name="Actual">Actual Technology Career</a></h3>
    <div class="text">
        <p>Mike earned his MBA from the University of Dayton, and focused on Managment Information Systems
            and Computer Science. He did such a good job while serving as a graduate assistant, he was
            hired initially as a developer, but was immediately fleeted up to the technology director
            position upon the resignation of the previous director. Included in his priorities were
            all workstation and network management (workstation imaging, network backup, Novell network
            management, user ID creation and management, etc). He even got to install and set up a donated
            Tera Data server for the MIS department. Overall there were about 100 staff accounts, 2000
            student accounts and two computer labs to maintain. This worked fine until his spouse decided
            Dayton, Ohio was a drag, and they needed to move to Hong Kong.

    <h3><a name="Leveraging">Leveraging Technology in USCG Career</a></h3>
    <div class="text">
        <p>After returning from Hong Kong, and learning that large white guys who can't speak chinese weren't
            needed after the handover, Mike returned to Active Duty in the Coast Guard on September 4, 2011.
            Yes, a week before 9/11. In the 17 years since Mike has been very busy managing the reserve program,
            And, in every job he has had, he has found numerous uses for this technology skills as the USCG is
            not the most intricate analysts of data. He leveraged his MS Access and Excel technologies to ascertain
            information from the largely untapped data sources within the Coast Guard. But, since his primary duties
            were not in data management, eventually the Coast Guard developed in house expertise who properly locked
            down the systems and made it harder to obtain information to get the job done. Eventually, promotions
            took Mike even further from his beloved data, until he was at the end of his career and ready to
            leave the Coast Guard and "transition" to a new field.

    <h3><a name="Future">Future Goals</a></h3>
    <div>
        <p>Ready to Transition, Mike is eager to return to his passion: developing new ideas, building new systems and
            squeezing better information from the data that makes up our day to day work life. We'll see where this
            journey leads . . . .</p>
